<p><strong>Student Hours:</strong> After class M and F from 5:30-6:30pm, or by appointment</p>

<h3><strong>What is this course about:</strong></h3>
<p>In this class we are going to learn fundamental principles in computer graphics.  This means, we will be learning how computer graphics libraries work enable developers to create realistic looking scenes of objects. </p> 

<p>We will be doing lots of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>linear algebra</strong> - computer graphics uses linear algebra - matrices, vectors, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>computational thinking</strong>- to learn how to translate complex scenes into pixels, efficiently</li>
  <li><strong>programming</strong>- we will put these ideas into practice using WebGL</li>
</ul>  

<p>At the end of this course, students will understand how to represent complex scenes in a format computer graphics engines can understand, and how these engines render these scenes efficiently.  We will also identify ongoing challenges that computer graphics practitioners are working to address through research and development.</p>
