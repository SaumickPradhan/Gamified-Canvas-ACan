<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true"><strong>1. Personal webpage to host a portfolio of your work in this class&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">I believe the excellent work you do in this class (and other classes) should be thoroughly documented and shared online.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a discussion with a Google resume screener once, and she told me that one of the best things you can do in your resume is have links to real projects with documentation and code.&nbsp;</div>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">To help you with this, your first assignment is to create a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>public webpage</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>where you will share the work you do in this class.&nbsp; If you already have a webpage, add a subpage or a section for this course.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>At a minimum this page should have your name* and the name of the course.</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also recommend having a photo of yourself and a brief biography and a link to your resume, but this is optional. &nbsp; * If you are uncomfortable sharing your name or other personal info online, you can use your first name and last initial.&nbsp; Let me know if you have any concerns. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true"><span>You can use any hosting service or webpage creation service that you would like- Google sites, squarespace, wix...&nbsp; I have used Google sites for this purpose in the past, and it works well for quickly sharing your work.&nbsp; And it is free.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; The goal here isn't to create a webpage from scratch.&nbsp; The goal is to have a platform for quickly documenting your course work, through text, images, links and videos.</span></div>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">
    <h3><strong>2. Create a github account for yourself</strong>, or send me your existing account name.&nbsp;</h3>
