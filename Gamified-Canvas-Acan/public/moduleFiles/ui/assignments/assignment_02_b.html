<h1>Sketching the interface</h1>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Suppose we have opened the photo sharing app</li>
    <li><strong>Draw two alternate versions of an interface for selecting the photos you want to share</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Each person on your team should draw one</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>One moment in time- can use annotations to suggest actions and causality (see below)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Suppose the users then do the authentication &ndash; like they bump the phones together, authentication success, photos transferred over.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Draw two alternate versions of an interface for accepting the photos on the other user&rsquo;s phone</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Each person on your team should draw one</strong><strong></strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Suppose you are making an interface to a microwave</li>
    <li>It should allow the user to input a time</li>
    <li>It should have some way to access commonly used settings</li>
    <li>It should have some indication of how much time is left</li>
    <li>It should indicate if the microwave is running or not</li>
    <li>It should indicate whether there is food in the microwave someone has left in and not removed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draw two alternate versions of this interface&nbsp;</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Each person on your team should draw one</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>One moment in time- can use annotations to suggest actions and causality (see below)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember- this may be the first time you have done this, and it is ok for it to be hard and the sketches to feel a bit rough.&nbsp; PRACTICE!!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some inspiration:</strong></p>
<p>It's ok (often good) to be sketchy:</p>

<p>Annotations will help you describe what you have drawn:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Text descriptions can elaborate on how the elements on your interface would work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
