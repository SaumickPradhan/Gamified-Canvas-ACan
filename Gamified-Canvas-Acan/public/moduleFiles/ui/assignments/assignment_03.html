<h2> Project 1 design checkpoint </h2>
<p>This is just a link for submitting a portion of your work project one. </p>

<p>Note- You still have time to work on designs in your project, and I will grade your project based on what you present on your final webpage.   This is just to keep you from letting work get delayed and to push you to create designs before you code.  I wanted to give you an excuse to make the time to sketch and brainstorm and capture needs before coding. </p>

<p>Here is specifically what you need to submit here: </p>

<p>A document or a link to your portfolio page with this content.  </p>

<p>This should show: Design work (design requirements gathering and sketching alternatives/brainstorming) and a sketch of the C-level prototype .  You do not need to submit B-level sketches or A-level sketches.  You do not need to implement your sketched alternatives in your project- so feel free to brainstorm freely! </p>

<p>Questions- ask away!</p>
