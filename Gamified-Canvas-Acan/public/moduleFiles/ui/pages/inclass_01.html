<h1><strong>Sketching Design Challenge-1</strong></h1>
<p>Adapted from Sketching User Experiences: The workbook, by Saul Greenberg, Sheelagh Carpendale, Nicolai, Marquardt, Bill Buxton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Design funnel, 10-plus-10 Method</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.State your design challenge</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>problem to solve</li>
    <li>client need</li>
    <li>novel system that takes advantage of particular technology&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Generate 10+ different design concepts that addresses that challenge</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>brainstorming</li>
    <li>be as creative and diverse as possible</li>
    <li>don&rsquo;t judge designs</li>
    <li>capture essence of idea, not details</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Reduce the number of design concepts OR repeat</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>review all designs</li>
    <li>discard ones that don&rsquo;t have merit</li>
    <li>use sketch to explain and get feedback on remaining designs from others</li>
    <li>gather reactions (including your own)</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
    <li>Based on reflection, repeat step 2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Choose the most promising concept(s)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Your starting point</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Produce 10 details / variations of that concept</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>explore the concept</li>
    <li>generate different ways of realizing the concept</li>
    <li>dig deeper in a particular way (i.e., flesh out details)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Present your ideas to a group</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>coffee / donuts go a long way</li>
    <li>solicit feedback (positive, what could be improved, etc.)</li>
    <li>Suggestions about redesigns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. As your ideas change, sketch them out</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>that is, go back to step 1, but deeper into the design funnel</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Design challenge 1:&nbsp; Connecting Two Smart Phones</strong></h3>
<p>How can two people connect their mobile devices for information exchange (e.g., photo transfer) without resorting to dialog boxes or other tedious interface requests?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many cases where you may want to connect your mobile smart phone to a nearby person's smart phone, for example to exchange information such as photos and contacts. While the network infrastructure is there for one phone to detect and connect to other nearby phones (eg. via Bluetooth), security requires that people somehow authenticate that connection through some initial sequence as there may be many people with smart phones within range.&nbsp; This usually involves dialogue boxes, cryptic requests and other demands on people that make this both tedious and difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this exercise, brainstorm 10 novel ways that 2 people can connect two mobile devices together that do not demand these painful dialogues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<ul>
    <li>mobile device detects nearby phones</li>
    <li>they can initially do some limited communication</li>
    <li>you and the person can perform some action that both phones recognize as a &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; affirming a full connection is desired. That is, it exploits social convention where you both agree to do something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hint: Think outside the box.&nbsp; Actions can be captured by typing, by sensors, and by any input/output mechanisms on your mobile device (accelerometer, flashlight/strobe light, screen, touch, microphone, camera, etc).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What you need to do:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>A.&nbsp; Sketch 10 ideas of different design concepts- NOTE- ALTERNATE WHO SKETCHES-<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 5 sketches for each person&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>B. Reduce the design concepts- list the ones you think are the most promising, and ones you would eliminate</p>
<p>C. Select one concept:&nbsp; Make 10 more sketches.&nbsp; &nbsp;Elaborate on that concept, explore missing details AND/OR sketch variations on that concept</p>
