<h1><strong>Sketching Design Challenge-3</strong></h1>
<p>Adapted from Sketching User Experiences: The workbook, by Saul Greenberg, Sheelagh Carpendale, Nicolai, Marquardt, Bill Buxton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Design funnel, 10-plus-10 Method</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.State your design challenge</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>problem to solve</li>
    <li>client need</li>
    <li>novel system that takes advantage of particular technology&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Generate 10+ different design concepts that addresses that challenge</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>brainstorming</li>
    <li>be as creative and diverse as possible</li>
    <li>don&rsquo;t judge designs</li>
    <li>capture essence of idea, not details</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Reduce the number of design concepts OR repeat</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>review all designs</li>
    <li>discard ones that don&rsquo;t have merit</li>
    <li>use sketch to explain and get feedback on remaining designs from others</li>
    <li>gather reactions (including your own)</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
    <li>Based on reflection, repeat step 2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Choose the most promising concept(s)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Your starting point</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Produce 10 details / variations of that concept</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>explore the concept</li>
    <li>generate different ways of realizing the concept</li>
    <li>dig deeper in a particular way (i.e., flesh out details)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Present your ideas to a group</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>coffee / donuts go a long way</li>
    <li>solicit feedback (positive, what could be improved, etc.)</li>
    <li>Suggestions about redesigns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. As your ideas change, sketch them out</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>that is, go back to step 1, but deeper into the design funnel</li>
</ul>

                                <p>Most computer displays have a power save mode.&nbsp; Typically, a person can enter that mode through some manual action (e.g. menu selection) or the system may do this automatically after a pre-determined amount of time.&nbsp; The computer then 'wakes up' when a person moves the mouse.&nbsp; The problem is that if the time-out period is long, screens stay on unnecessarily even when a person is away.&nbsp; While people can switch it off manually, they often don't bother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Generate alternate approaches to this strategy.&nbsp; If you get stuck, feel free to equip your display (or your environment) with sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>A.&nbsp; Sketch 10 ideas of different design concepts with a partner.&nbsp; NOTE- ALTERNATE WHO SKETCHES- 5 sketches for each person&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>B. Reduce the design concepts- list the ones you think are the most promising, and ones you would eliminate</p>
                                <p>C. Select one concept- the one that excites you the most, and make 10 variations on that concept</p>
                                <p>D. Discuss with another pair of designers in the class</p>
