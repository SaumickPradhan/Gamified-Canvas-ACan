<h2>Wednesday activity</h2>
<p>Let's continue with the smart fridge UI we played with last time.&nbsp; As a reminder, this is what we did, but you can take the folder from last time and continue working on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open the html file in your favorite editor.&nbsp; I like sublime text: <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com//" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.sublimetext.com/.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>AND open the css file in your favorite editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Edit the html file to add&nbsp; MORE text, buttons, images, controls to create some of the functionalities of a smart fridge listed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. As you go, view the result in your browser.&nbsp; You can just double click on the html file to view it in the browser.&nbsp; I suggest Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Inspect your page using the web developer tools in Chrome (View &gt;&gt; Developer &gt;&gt; Developer Tools).&nbsp; Look at the elements and where they are onscreen, and the layout and sizing decisions computed by the layout engine in the Chrome browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Test out editing the html in the developer console to see immediate changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOW:</p>
<p>Try&nbsp;</p>
<p>A. Grouping elements into div's.&nbsp; How does it change your layout?&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Use &lt;br&gt; to separate elements.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Give elements class names, in your html code.&nbsp; And write style rules for those classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set their color</li>
    <li>Choose a new font and font size</li>
    <li>Add rounded corners if it is a div</li>
    <li>Try some things!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
