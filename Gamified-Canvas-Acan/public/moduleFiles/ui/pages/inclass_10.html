<p>To review: the activity last time involved</p>
<ul>
    <li>adding event listeners to components on your page, write functions that translate these actions into changes on screen.&nbsp; An example would be- clicking a button updates the temperature the user has set, and this should be displayed visually in the interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>creating an array of objects that store about how the user opens the fridge.&nbsp; Every time they 'open' the fridge, a new entry would go into the array storing how long the fridge was left open, how the temperature changed (Start temp, ending temp)- in different compartments, whether they removed anything, which shelf registered a change....&nbsp; For now, pretend it is the middle of the day and they have opened the fridge a number of times.&nbsp; How would this array look?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Use array functions to compute some data on this array- such as the average time opened today, or the max time opened.&nbsp; Display this within your page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add a clock to your Fridge.&nbsp; Can you have it update every second?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Add an event listener for key presses.&nbsp; When the user presses 'o', print a message to console saying "open fridge".&nbsp; When the user presses 's', print a message to the console saying "simulate a day".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. When the press the 'o' button, try to run a function to simulate opening the fridge, as we discussed in class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. When they press the 's' button, you could run the simulation function.&nbsp; Try to test out how this might work.</p>
