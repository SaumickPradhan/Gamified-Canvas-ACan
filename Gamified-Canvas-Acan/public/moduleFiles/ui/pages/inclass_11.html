<h1><strong> Design Principles In-Class Activity-1</strong></h1>
<p>Canvas is a big improvement over the software that was prevalent when I was a student (Blackboard).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, maybe we can make it even simpler?&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In a small group, consider your Canvas page for a course- like my UI course.&nbsp; Look at the buttons on the side.&nbsp; What buttons do you actually use?&nbsp; What don't you use?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to this powerpoint presentation, link here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WE8JLCnx4R03llHnT6fsPO0P7RNIJmNoAAcXv3Q8_wo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WE8JLCnx4R03llHnT6fsPO0P7RNIJmNoAAcXv3Q8_wo/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>Select a slide to edit, add your names in the comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you shade out the features you rarely use?&nbsp; Highlight the features you use frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What would you say is the core feature of canvas for your group. What do you actually use it for?&nbsp; Can you write it down in a sentence or two?&nbsp; Add it to the comments of the powerpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Try sketching an alternate canvas page, that focuses on these features.&nbsp; Take a screen shot and add it to a new slide next to your original critique.&nbsp;</p>
