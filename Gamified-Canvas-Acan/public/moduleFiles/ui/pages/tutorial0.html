<h1><strong>Tutorial-0: The Web</strong></h1>
<p>If we are going to develop interactive applications for the web, we need to understand a little bit about how the web works.&nbsp; This tutorial is going to give a very basic overview of how the web works, which will allow us to get started with web development, and I will have links you can follow to deepen your understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tutorial draws heavily from Chapter 3 of <span>Scott Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Interactive Data Visualization for the Web&rdquo;, which is available for free to UC students through the O'Reilly online portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>What is the Web?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>When we think of the web, we think of our experience with the web, navigating through a bunch of interlinked pages.&nbsp; But, if we look underneath this experience, what we actually have is a conversation between&nbsp;<strong>web servers </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>web clients (or browsers).</strong></p>
<p>Let's imagine how this conversation might go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user clicks a link on a web page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLIENT:&nbsp; "I would like to see what is available at somewebsite.com.&nbsp; Let me call and see if I can get the latest info"</p>
<p>SERVER: "Hello web client.&nbsp; I am the server hosting somewebsite.com.&nbsp; What page are you looking for?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLIENT:&nbsp; "I would like to retrieve a page at somewebsite.com/news/.</p>
<p>SERVER: "Yes, let me get that for you, one moment."</p>
<p>Code is transmitted from SERVER to CLIENT</p>
<p>CLIENT: "Got it, thanks!"</p>
<p>SERVER: "You are welcome.&nbsp; Sorry I can't stay and chat, but I have other folks on the line i need to help. Let me know if you need anything else!"</p>
<p>Clients contact servers with requests and servers respond with data.&nbsp; Servers are connected to the internet, and they run software that is designed to serve web documents when requested.&nbsp; The servers you think about serve content publicly, and are always on.&nbsp; You can also run a local server, which means they run on the same computer that you are working on.&nbsp; Local refers to the fact that only your computer can access the content.&nbsp; Here's my tutorial on how to run a local server using python simple server.&nbsp; It is how I often develop web content initially.&nbsp; Often web servers are written in Apache, and are complex.&nbsp; You can also write servers using node.js, which is much easier to get started with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How do web browsers work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Web browsers are software applications take act as the client in the above scenario. They request pages from servers, they receive the code sent by the page, and run it, presenting the results to the user.&nbsp; The browser interprets the html, javascript and other content sent by the server, and presents it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The part of the browser we see, is its <strong>user interface.</strong>&nbsp; The tabs, the search bar, the refresh button.&nbsp; This is the interface which connects the users to the functionality of the browser- retrieving and presenting and enabling us to interact with content on servers.&nbsp; Between the UI and the backend components is the browser engine, which connects the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real work of deciding what to present to users based on the code fetched from the servers is done by a <strong>rendering engine</strong> that interprets the html, the images and other content, and decides how to lay things out. The rendering engine will traverse the html '<em>content tree' or DOM</em> (which we discuss in the next section).&nbsp; It parses the css files and style elements.&nbsp; Parsing involves taking the rules written by developers in html, tokenizing it, grabbing the tags, producing something the rendering engine can read and work off of.&nbsp; You can read more about it <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://web.dev/howbrowserswork/#Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; The parser constructs a <em>render tree</em>, which consists in the visual elements in the order they will be displayed.&nbsp; After constructing the render tree, the rendering engine in the browser will compute the <em>layout of elements</em>.&nbsp; Elements are specified in hierarchical groups, with different indicated layout rules, such as whether elements are center aligned, or sized to fill the parent container horizontally, etc.&nbsp; The layout process translates this information into actual positions and sizes for elements on the screen.&nbsp; Then the rendering engine&nbsp;<strong>paints</strong> the content.&nbsp; This means it has a backend UI layer which decides, based on the specified elements, style rules and layouts how to fill in the pixels within the browser window.&nbsp; Lots of optimization goes on to make sure users have a smooth experience, and content is presented and updated quickly for the user.&nbsp; There is an open source rendering engine out there if you are curious, called <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://webkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webkit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the flow of webkits rendering engine: (image from <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://web.dev/howbrowserswork/#Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p>

<p>Browsers have a<strong> javascript interpreter.</strong>&nbsp; The interpreter can fetch external javascript files specified in the code, as well as internal ones.&nbsp; It interprets the javascript code written by the developer.&nbsp; Here you can draw on your experience with other languages.&nbsp; Javascript is not compiled into machine code and run on the machine.&nbsp; Javascript is interpreted, which means its execution begins immediately.&nbsp; The browser's javascript interpreter is a bit like a virtual machine, in the sense that you, the developer, do not need to worry about compiling your code for different machines, because it runs within the browser, which is itself compiled into machine code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Javascript has a garbage collector.&nbsp; But, if you create lots of large global variables, these stick around for the entire run of the program, and you could potentially be wasting memory.&nbsp; This has never been an issue for me, but it is worth keeping in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The browser runs an event loop, which listens for user actions continuously.&nbsp; It catches these events (mouse clicks, keyboard key presses....) so that these can be responded to.&nbsp; &nbsp;Developers can create different event listeners which pay attention for events within the event loop.&nbsp; You can also set intervals and timeouts, to control the execution of a process over time, like an animation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code you write in Javascript executes within a single thread- it has one call stack, where the operations are pushed.&nbsp; But then how do we avoid having our code stall while waiting for something to be retrieved or events to run?&nbsp; This is where we need to think about doing certain tasks <strong>asynchronously&nbsp;</strong>or taking advantage of the event loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will get into these topics more as we create web applications, but hopefully this was a helpful general picture of what happens when you write code for the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some great resources if you want to learn more, and which I used to write this tutorial.&nbsp;</p>
