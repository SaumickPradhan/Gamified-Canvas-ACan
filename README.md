Interview-3: Aerospace Engineering major first-year student at UC Davis
  
#### How do you access your assignments and plan to complete them in time? 
I access my assignments on Canvas by logging into my account and navigating to the specific course where the assignment is located. Usually, the assignments are listed in a dedicated section or under a specific tab. To plan for completing them on time, I usually create a digital calendar on Google, which my university uses predominantly, to keep track of assignment due dates and prioritize them accordingly. The Canvas calendar is useful for this as well! 
#### How do you motivate yourself to complete your assignments? 
Motivation can be a tricky challenge, especially for challenging assignments. I find that breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable parts helps. Additionally, I try to remind myself of my long-term goals and how completing assignments is essential for my academic success. Sometimes, I join study groups or work with my classmates and friends to stay motivated and accountable.  
#### How do you ask for help when you are stuck? 
Canvas provides several ways to ask for help. I can use discussion boards, send messages to instructors or friends, or even attend the TA or instructor office hours. When I'm stuck on a specific assignment, I usually start by posting a question on the discussion board or sending a message to the instructor. If I don't receive a timely response, I reach out to my friends for help. 
  
#### How do you feel about the assignment submission windows in Canvas? 
I find the assignment submission windows in Canvas to be reasonable. They typically provide adequate time for completing and submitting assignments. However, it's important to keep track of these windows, as missing a deadline can result in penalties.  
  
####  Do you like how you are able to submit your exams? 
Submitting exams on Canvas is straightforward. I appreciate the convenience of being able to complete exams digitally and receive instant feedback in some cases. However, it can be stressful, especially for high-stakes exams, as there is often a time limit. The exams with free-response questions especially, are the ones that are the most stressful because I don’t know how the professor or TA will grade it. 
  
 
#### What do you think could have been better with the way you submit your assignments? 
One improvement could be providing clearer instructions for assignment submissions on Canvas. Sometimes, the process can be confusing, especially for new students. It would also be helpful if Canvas allowed for multiple file uploads in a more user-friendly manner. I hate having to click the “Add File” button like 10 times for 10 different files. It would have been so much easier to submit my assignments if I could select multiple files in one go!  
  
#### To what extent do you feel you are able to ask for help through Canvas – Be it your peers or your instructors? 
I generally feel that Canvas offers several ways to ask for help, both from peers and instructors. The discussion boards and messaging system are useful for reaching out to instructors and classmates. However, the effectiveness of the help received varies based on the responsiveness of instructors and the willingness of peers to assist, which has fortunately been good so far. 
  
#### How do you feel about being incentivized to play games on Canvas for extra credit? 
I think the idea of incentivizing students to play games on Canvas for extra credit is very intriguing. It can be a fun and engaging way to earn additional points. I would definitely be interested in seeing this on my Canvas. It would make the entire process of using Canvas much more fun, in my opinion. I am also intrigued to know how this would be implemented! 
  
#### What games do you play to relax from work/exams? 
I often play casual mobile games to relax, such as puzzle games such as the 2048 game and strategy games like chess. These provide a break from academics and help me unwind after a long day. Sometimes, I also engage in physical activities or sports to de-stress. I also play games like Clash of Clans and Call of Duty, which are a little time-consuming, so I usually play them before bed for like an hour or so. 
  
#### To what extent do rewards and penalties in games motivate you? 
Rewards motivate me to keep playing the game for longer, and it also makes it much more fun to engage in a friendly competition with my friends to see who has the most rewards. Penalties, on the other hand, are quite disheartening, for the lack of a better word. I hate penalties! They are a buzzkill for me to be honest. But they enable me to see what I did wrong, so I can avoid doing that the next time I play the game, which often leads to more rewards! So, yeah, rewards are motivating! 
 
 
 
Interview-4: Computer Science major junior at UC 
 
#### How do you access your assignments and plan to complete them in time?  
Accessing assignments on Canvas is convenient. I typically log into my Canvas account and navigate to the respective course page. The assignment details, instructions, and due dates are readily available. To ensure I complete assignments on time, I use the Canvas Calendar to track assignment deadlines. This way, I can efficiently manage my time and prioritize tasks. Sometimes, even my friends remind me that an assignment’s due date is coming up, so that is another way I end up completing it on time! I often break down larger assignments into smaller tasks and allocate specific time slots for them. 
 
#### How do you motivate yourself to complete your assignments?  
Motivation can be a challenge, especially for complex programming assignments. To stay motivated, I often set personal goals and milestones for each assignment. Breaking the task into smaller, manageable parts makes it less daunting. I find that setting clear goals and focusing on the practical applications of what I'm learning can be highly motivating. Collaborating with my friends on group projects also adds an element of healthy competition and motivation. 
 
#### How do you ask for help when you are stuck?  
I try to look up the problems online, firstly, on sites like GeeksForGeeks or StackOverflow. If I 	can’t find anything there, I try to ask my friends if they know how to solve the problem. I also use the class Discord channel to discuss the problem with my classmates to see if they faced the same problem and how they solved it. The last resort is to ask the professor or TA about it. 
 
#### How do you feel about the assignment submission windows in Canvas?  
I think the assignment submission window on Canvas is good. It mentions everything I need to know about the assignment such as the instructions, due date details, the number of points it’s worth, etc. So, I would say it has sufficient information for me to turn in my assignment on time efficiently. I just wish I could select multiple files in one go! 
 
#### Do you like how you are able to submit your exams?  
Submitting exams on Canvas is straightforward, but it depends on the exam format. For multiple-choice or short-answer exams, I think Canvas is efficient. However, for coding questions or written exams involving equations and calculations, it could be improved to provide a more user-friendly text editor and ensure compatibility with various programming languages. 
 
#### What do you think could have been better with the way you submit your assignments?  
While Canvas is effective for assignment submission, it could be enhanced by providing a built-in code editor that supports multiple programming languages. Additionally, a plagiarism checker integrated into the submission process would be beneficial for maintaining academic integrity. Canvas could also improve the assignment submission process by allowing students to submit multiple code files more easily, as I mentioned earlier. This is especially important in computer science, where assignments often involve multiple code components. 
 
#### To what extent do you feel you are able to ask for help through Canvas – Be it your peers or your instructors?  
I think the Discussion Board on Canvas is helpful to some extent for asking questions, but people don’t use it too often, so I usually depend on the class communication channels such as Discord or GroupMe. Or I just email the professor directly, because often they are not aware of the conversation on the Discussion Board, or they have disabled it for the course! The discussions on Discord, GroupMe, and (sometimes) Canvas are particularly useful for sharing code snippets and troubleshooting. 
 
#### How do you feel about being incentivized to play games on Canvas for extra credit?  
Incentivizing games for extra credit is an interesting concept, especially if the games are designed to reinforce course content. It can make learning more engaging. However, the games should be thoughtfully integrated into the curriculum and align with the learning objectives. Playing games for extra credit could also be a source of motivation for people to study more if it involves using concepts learned in class to play it. 
 
#### What games do you play to relax from work/exams?   
I play games like Subway Surfers, Clash of Clans, Call of Duty, and Ludo, depending on my mood. I just use these games to relax after a busy day, so it’s probably just for a few minutes at the end of the day or after a stressful exam. I also enjoy multiplayer online games for relaxation. 
 
#### To what extent do rewards and penalties in games motivate you? 
Rewards and penalties in games can be motivating, especially when they are designed effectively. Earning points or achievements in games can be a satisfying way to track progress. Receiving in-game rewards or achieving high scores can also be a strong incentive to continue playing. Penalties, however, should be fair and not overly punitive, as excessive penalties can be demotivating. Personal preferences and the quality of game design play a significant role in how motivating rewards and penalties are.

Hard deadlines can be stressful when pushing work to the last minute. But it is understandable that some sort of deadline should be in place. Doesn’t feel Canvas does good enough job reminding you of your assignments. 
#### Do you like how you are able to submit your exams? 
Depends on how the professor sets up the exam. Has had exams where once a question is submitted, can’t go back. Also doesn’t like exams that don’t show results in any way at end. No problem with honor system and cheating rules. 
#### What do you think could have been better with the way you submit your assignments? 
Reminders for assignments when they are due in 24 hours or maybe even more customizable options. Some sort of better way to organize upcoming assignments like a calendar app. 
#### To what extent do you feel you are able to ask for help through Canvas – Be it your peers or your instructors? 
Getting help through Canvas is ok. Has messaged teachers through messaging system and gotten responses. Seems like open discussion boards aren’t used. Never really messaged students except to form groups.

Checks the Canvas app on mobile phone regularly to keep up with assignment dates. Then completes assignments through personal laptop. Does not keep a calendar of upcoming assignments, only checks Canvas and remembers. 
#### How do you motivate yourself to complete your assignments? 
Has a hard time getting motivated but will usually stay on task once started. Likes to go to Coffee shop where they have nothing to do but work. Public can get loud and distracting, sometimes prefers quiet. 
#### How do you ask for help when you are stuck? 
Likes to check who is in class with them on Canvas to reach out about assignments/help. Same goes for contacting the professor, has reached out to them through Canvas. 
#### How do you feel about the assignment submission windows in Canvas? 
Usually not a problem for them. Sometimes an assignment or two slips through the cracks given how they keep track of assignments, but they get why deadlines are needed.  
#### Do you like how you are able to submit your exams? 
Does not like Canvas for exams. Gets very nervous for exams anyways, computer problems exasperate that. Only thing they like is typing essays for exams on Canvas instead of writing by hand.  
#### What do you think could have been better with the way you submit your assignments? 
Does not like assignment submission on Canvas. Is not a computer wiz and struggles mightily with converting file types for submissions. Usually ends up taking a while to do or needing help.  
#### To what extent do you feel you are able to ask for help through Canvas – Be it your peers or your instructors? 
Reached out to peers a good amount. Whether it is for access to class group messaging boards, or just help with assignments, they like group work. Never really reaches out to teacher through Canvas, only email.  
#### How do you feel about being incentivized to play games on Canvas for extra credit? 
Likes the idea but is nervous for all non gamers who might be at a disadvantage. Feels not every student might be able to make the most of this system. Thinks giving out more chances for extra credit is good.  
#### What games do you play to relax from work/exams? 
Not a big gamer at all. Only really ever plays the Sims to relax. Sometimes likes to play Candy Crush. Not familiar with most game systems/conventions. 
#### To what extent do rewards and penalties in games motivate you? 
In the games they do play, rewards and penalties are motivating. Gets sad when Sims die, and thinks beating difficult challenges is very rewarding. Thinks it could be good to get more students excited about work.

  <summary><b>Learnings and Report</b></summary>
  
#### What is their method to solve their problems and questions during the assignment completion window?  
A lot of students check the To-do or Assignments pages to keep track of deadlines. A lot of students use a personal calendar to assist with this. Some students use Canvas’s calendar and reminder system, but not all students were aware of the functionalities of this 
#### We will be observing how they work with other peers. How do they use the different features on Canvas and what buttons or pages do they use the most?  
Students spend a lot of time on the courses page, looking at all sorts of course related information there. Different majors use different connectivity features like discussion boards in different amounts. Lots of students like to reach out to each other for group work. 
#### What is their motivation to open canvas and why would they prefer the desktop version over the mobile version or vice versa? 
Some students check canvas regularly for announcements, assignment updates, or sanity checks. However, while some of this can be made easier on the go with the mobile app, students love the desktop version for actual work. 
#### What incentives will help students be motivated 
Students seem to be motivated by stress-relief, but not enough for most of them to get their work done in an early manner. Rankings, points, and medals do motivate gamers, but non-gamers can be motivated with deadline extension or extra credit 
#### Different types of assignments the user would encounter on Canvas 
Whether it is essays, exams, discussions, labs, or projects, all sorts of assignments are submitted through canvas. Different majors make different use of this. 
#### Canvas and students can benefit from a more intrinsically motivating teaching platform 
This definitely seems to be true. A lots of students mentioned procrastination or somewhat struggling with time management. Different forms of motivation could help with this problem. 
#### How students plan out their assignments and what strategies they use to stay on track – this would help us to figure out a way to improve our UI 
A lot of students check the To-do or Assignments pages to keep track of deadlines. A lot of students use a personal calendar to assist with this. Some students use Canvas’s calendar and reminder system, but not all students were aware of the functionalities of this

<summary><b>Contextual inquiry findings</b></summary>

#### 1.  Interviewed, Jenna Lowes is a second year pre-med major, who uses Canvas: 

When collaborating with colleagues, Jenna makes the most of Canvas as her primary platform for interaction. She actively participates in online discussions and group projects with other pre-med students along with sharing her insights. She also regularly participates in peer research groups created in Canvas to foster effective collaboration on complex topics. 
Some of the features that Jenna uses: 
Announcements: Jenna uses the Announcements page to keep herself updated on important course information, schedule changes, and significant announcements from instructors. 
Modules: To access course materials, lecture notes, and assignments in an organized manner, Jenna relies on the modules section. This approach helps Jenna maintain a structured and well-organized approach to her studies. 
Grades: Jenna frequently checks the grades tab to keep a close eye on her academic progress. This tool allows her to review her grades and receive feedback on her assignments and exams. She also uses the prediction feature in the grades section to ensure that she is getting the grade she deserves. 
Discussion Boards: Depending on the course, Jenna actively participates in discussion boards to engage with peers and instructors, pose thought-provoking questions, and share her valuable insights. 
Assignments: Jenna effectively employs the assignments page to submit her coursework and to stay well-informed about due dates and specific assignment requirements. 
  
When asked about her preference for the web version or the app version, Jenna replied that she distinctly prefers the desktop version of Canvas for several compelling reasons: 
  
Screen size: The desktop version's responsive screen space provides Jenna with an ideal workspace, making it convenient for her to access and organize course materials. She believes this feature is especially useful when multitasking with multiple canvas tabs or scrolling through large PDFs. 
  
Efficiency: Jenna thinks it is more efficient to write out long essays and paragraphs on her laptop. Thus, she prefers the web version over the app version. 
  
Course Management: Jenna finds that the desktop version streamlines navigation through courses, modules, and assignments. This helps Jenna maintain a well-organized and efficient approach to her studies. 
  
While Jenna acknowledges the practicality of the mobile version for quick updates and checking announcements while on the move, she acknowledges its limitations for more involved tasks like in-depth interactions, essay composition, or comprehensive course exploration. Therefore, her go-to choice for substantial tasks on Canvas remains the desktop version. 
 
 
#### 2. Interviewed, Dhyey Patel is a fourth-year computer science major, who uses Canvas: 
Dhyey uses different features on Canvas depending on his needs and preferences. Some of the features he uses the most are: 
 
Dashboard: He uses the dashboard to view all of his courses, assignments, announcements, and calendar events.  
Courses: He accesses all his enrolled courses and their contents, such as modules, quizzes, discussions, grades, and files from here. He also views his course syllabus and outcomes here.  
Calendar: Dhyey uses this tab to see all upcoming events and deadlines for his courses and personal tasks. He also adds new reminders for events or edits an existing one. 
Inbox: He uses this to communicate with his instructors and peers. 
Account: He uses this to manage his personal settings and preferences, such as profile, notifications etc. 
 
He uses Canvas for various purposes, such as checking his grades, submitting assignments, participating in discussions, reviewing course materials, and collaborating with others. 
 
Dhyey prefers the desktop version of Canvas over the mobile version because he finds it more convenient and comfortable to use a larger screen and a keyboard. He also likes the desktop version because it has more features and functionalities than the mobile version. But he sometimes uses the mobile version when he is on the go or needs to access something quickly from his phone.

<details>
  <summary><b>c) Feedback</b> </summary>
Feedback from Jenna, one of the students interviewed for questions and contextual inquiry: The website looks great, especially the UI! I love how you've implemented the assignments and modules page!
<br>  
  
</details>



<details>
  <summary><b>d)	Interactive application with interface goals</b></summary>
  Code an be found under Gamified-Canvas-ACan folder. Run using "npm run dev" in React. The Simulation with the "TO THE FUTURE" button is in a different Repo: https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/Gamified-Canvas-Simulation
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>e) Implementation principles</b></summary>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Consider visual design principles in your design:</b></summary>
    i.The UI has simplicity in using. All the features and interactive options are clearly laid out. The feature have regularity and in font size, color and other styling.<br>
ii.	The visual hierarchy is similar to Canvas but Gamified, based on above mentioned Games, which the user is familiar with. <br>
iii.	Not much learning is required as it has a layout similar to other Game UI. This helps in Learnability as there is a continuity in the UI from other platforms<br>
iv.	Proximity of all the pages is seen. Also the controls are well spaced in their own grids. Easy to show navigation and current page<br>
v.	Color is same throughout and the user is able to familiarize with it quickly.<br>
vi.	Controls are visually represented and easy to access. They provide feedback for every interaction.<br>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><b>Provide appropriate feedback for interactions</b></summary>
i For this Mock UI, the user already knows what to click as the controls, apps, sliders, etc. as familiar.<br>
ii.	Drop down menus and windows are interactable with feedback<br>
iii.	The username can be seen at the top<br>
iv.	The buttons have a different click arrow.<br>
v.  The SIMULATION and MOCK USERS can easily be tested. <br>
  </details>

   <details>
    <summary><b>Elements should be clearly laid out.  Your interface for the smart object should have fixed dimensions (non-resizing, non-responsive layout) with size and aspect ratio that is appropriate for your object.</b></summary>
  i.The mock UI handles resizing.<br>
ii.	Boundaries are clearly laid out on the webpage.   <br>

  </details>
</details>



**B GOALS**
<details>
<summary><b>a)	For the B goals, the student has to be able to complete the following tasks </b></summary>
  <details>
   <summary><b>Submit assignments - Submission needs to have text entry and document upload options.</b></summary>
   
   There are quite a few things going on with this interface – The student can select the assignment they wish to submit, and choose to select options for Bonus Points or Due Date Extensions, based on the policies set by their instructor. 
   
   <b>They can then use the File Submission window to select and submit a file from their device or use the Text Entry submission for turning in their work.</b> 

   The submission button (a.k.a. the "Submit Assignment" button), when clicked, automatically "submits" the assignment and reloads the page without the student having to click anything.

  </details>

  <details>
   <summary><b>Access course materials - view or download presentations</b></summary>
   
   The student is able to view all the course material through the course modules, the components of which are color-coded as follows:

   i. The _Blue-colored_ components of the module are the course material that the student can read, such as the Syllabus, in-class activities, or tutorials.

   ii. The _Green-colored_ components of the module are the presentations that the instructor has uploaded.

   iii. The _Red-colored_ components of the module are the assignments that the instructor has assigned to the student.

   iv. The _Pink-colored_ component of the module is that of the project information.

   <b>The student can preview the documents using the  <img width="15" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/Gamified-Canvas-ACan/assets/90214774/7cc9abdb-3a8e-4878-a624-448f6e0d6de0">  button and download the documents using the  <img width="15" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/Gamified-Canvas-ACan/assets/90214774/50d32220-eac6-479e-a7dd-b37037c53854">  button.</b>

  </details>


  <details>
   <summary><b>View their grades on assignments, and their grade in the course so far, according to the instructor's grade weighting scheme.</b></summary>
   
   The student is able to view their grades on the different assignments, exams, and quizzes in the GradeBook (a.k.a. the "Grades" section) according to the instructor's weighting scheme (used from the mock data given in the zip file).

  <img width="1413" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/Gamified-Canvas-ACan/assets/90214774/d5f46b32-df99-46a7-903a-82b713590dac">

  </details>

  <details>
   <summary><b>Plan their work - using a calendar or to-do list.</b></summary>
   
   The student is able to use the to-do list feature (a.k.a. the "Task Triumphs Zone") to plan out their work, according to their needs.

   They can use the "Add" button to add new tasks to the task list and use the "Edit" button to edit any to-do on their list. They can either click on the to-do list item to mark it as completed (highlighted in blue with a strikethrough font), or use the "Remove" button to get rid of the task from the list altogether.

  </details>


  <details>
   <summary><b>Zoom connection option.</b></summary>
   
   The student can also use the Zoom Lectures feature to attend classes online, for which they are awarded a certain number of ACan Points by their instructor, as shown below. This feature shows them which classes they have attended and which ones they have not yet attended. We envision these to either be live lectures or video recordings posted by their instructor for which they can receive credit for either of them.

  <img width="1372" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/Gamified-Canvas-ACan/assets/90214774/80353c4c-5e58-4cfa-bda8-b8df065a30b9">

<details>
   <summary><b>b) As students do tasks in this class, the UI should update to reflect their progress in the class, using your gamification approach.  You should be able to perform a sequence of tasks for the student and see changes in the UI.</b></summary>
   
   As the student does their tasks in the class, all of it gets logged in the Rewards Center as and when they receive (or lose) ACan Points for their work. 

   For example, if the student submits their assignment 5 days before the deadline, they get awarded 20 ACan Points, whereas they get 10 ACan Points deducted for submitting their quiz late, as shown in the screenshot below:

   > (I) love the design of your login page! It's super clean and simple, and it's easy to use. I especially like the way you've used the UC logo and bearcat image. They add a nice touch of personality. I'm sure your users will love the new login page! It's fresh, modern, and easy to use.
>
Here are a few minor suggestions:
>
>Add a border around the login form to make it pop.
>Make the "LOG IN!!" button bigger and more colorful.
>Maybe add functionality to enable the users to save their login info, so they don't have to remember it every time they want to access your Alterna-Canvas!
